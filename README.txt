For this project, I impelmented the skip lists data structure.

The skip list functions similarly to a Linked List, except it can perform searches, deletions, and insertions in logarithmic time. The skip list is sorted. 

This is accomplished by having multiple "layers," where each layer holds its own smaller linked list. A searching, deletion, and insertion algorithm starts at the top layer and 
moves down as certain conditions are met. 

This project was developed independently.
